            The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, commonly known as RERA, is a central law that was enacted in India
            in 2016 with the aim of protecting the interests of homebuyers and promoting transparency in the real estate sector.
            Kerala, like all other Indian states, has also implemented RERA to regulate the real estate sector in the state.
            <br>
            The RERA Kerala Act came into effect on January 1, 2020, and applies to all real estate projects and agents
            operating in the state. The act mandates that all real estate developers register their projects with the Kerala
            Real Estate Regulatory Authority (K-RERA) before advertising, marketing, or selling any property. This registration
            process ensures that the project is compliant with all legal requirements, including obtaining necessary approvals,
            and provides homebuyers with greater clarity about the project's status.
            <br>
            The RERA Kerala Act also mandates that all real estate agents operating in the state must obtain a registration
            certificate from K-RERA. The act lays down strict guidelines and standards for real estate agents, including
            ensuring that they provide accurate information to buyers, maintain all relevant documents, and follow ethical
            practices.
            <br>
            One of the most significant provisions of the RERA Kerala Act is the establishment of a Real Estate Regulatory
            Authority (RERA) in the state. The K-RERA is responsible for implementing the provisions of the act and ensuring
            that developers and agents comply with its regulations. The authority also has the power to adjudicate disputes
            between buyers and developers and impose penalties on those who violate the act's provisions.
            <br>
            In summary, the RERA Kerala Act is a significant step towards regulating the real estate sector in the state and
            protecting the interests of homebuyers. The act aims to promote transparency and accountability in the sector, and
            with the establishment of K-RERA, it is expected to create a more transparent and efficient real estate market in
            Kerala.
